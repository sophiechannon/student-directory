#student-directory

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy. It has the following features:

* add students
* view students
* save file
* load file
* search by cohort
* view by cohort
* remove students
* edit students

## Bonus features

**Features I have added that were not required by the exercise:**

* pronoun switcher that uses gender specific or neutral pronouns depending on the students selected gender
* save as
* save upon exit
* cohort validation using Ruby's inbuilt date object
* default cohort determined by current month
* ability to quit an operation mid way
* search by cohort, remove, and edit are also additional to the main task requirements

## How to use

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
